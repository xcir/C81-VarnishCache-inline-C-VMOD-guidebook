The goal of this guide book is to provide the Varnish user community with documentation for usage of Inline-C within Varnish as well as how to go about when extending Varnish Cache with Modules, so called VMODs.

Hopefully the long-term result of this work is to add parts of its content into the Varnish Documentation as well as the Varnish Book.
